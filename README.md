# Brainy Day
NCSU Software Development Milestone Project 1 

## Description

My project was inspired by a book I read awhile back called *Tommorow and Tommorow and Tommorow* by Gabrielle Zevin. In this book one of the main characters, Sadie, creates a simple game for one of her classes; in this game named *Emily Blaster* the player shoots items on the screen and builds a poem based off of the sentences shot. In my game the player will shoot at raindrops containing numbers. The goal is to solve math problems, if the correct numbers are shot to solve the math problem the score will go up. If the player gets a problem wrong they will lose a life. Once the score reaches the goal the rain will stop and the sun comes out, indicating that the player has won! On the other hand, if all lives are lost the screen will flood and the player will lose.
